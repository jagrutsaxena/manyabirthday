It’s been <b>13 years</b> since we became friends.<br><br>
That’s 4,745 days of talking, laughing, fighting, and never giving up on each other.<br><br>
Some people meet and forget.<br>
We met… and stayed.

We don’t have photos together…<br>
but that just means we were too busy living the moments 💙
